# :cat: The Pet Cat Bot

## Project Overview
We are building a laser-guided GPS mapper robot that functions as a cat.

## :octocat: Key Features
Our robot has two main features:

    1. Interactive control with laser;

    2. Collecting the route data.

That means we can guide the robot with a laser pointer, just like how we play with cats. The robot automatically collects location data while operating, and will save the location data for mapping around the area.

## What we did?
To achieve these two features, we focused our work on our VESC module, GNSS module, and OAKD Lite Camera module.

### VESC module - PyVESC
steering and throttle trying for analog stuff

### GNSS module - 
location errors and data parsing 

### OAKD Lite Camera module - 
color detection and computer vision
